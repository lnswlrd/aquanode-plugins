# Aquanode Plugins

Aquanode Plugins is a large collection of VST3 audio plugins written in JUCE / C++ with the help of Claude AI.
Every plugin is free and open source, and I compiled them as both VST3 and sometimes as standalone app for Windows, as well as a few ports for Android. Mac ports are available in a fork of this repo, see the Download section below.

Synths inspired by hardware modules do not contain any proprietary code or other material, everything is done from scratch or credited open source material.
Scroll down for a list of included plugins, separated by synth (sound generation) and effect plugin types.
Next to Windows, the plugins should also compile for Mac and Linux. I only provide Windows builds here, since I only have a Windows machine.

The plugins should all work reliably, but definitely are not all "industry standard production quality" - please excuse the occasional bugs or
missing features or unexpected behaviour especially when you try to deep dive into a plugin :)

# Downloads

All of my builds as well as Presets and Samples are on the [Releases](../../releases) page, sorted by type: One `.zip` file for `.vst3`, one for `.exe`, one for `.apk` and one for Presets and Samples each. These are named accordingly, such as `aquanode-plugins-windows-vst3.zip`.

The source code and manuals (the "README" files) are available in the repository directly, of which you can download a `.zip` bundle directly here: https://github.com/aquanodemusic/aquanode-plugins/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Many of the plugins are also available for Mac here, thanks to the artist and Apple developer from CutUp Studios:

# Support 

Feel free to make your own forks of this repository! That said, I prefer to keep this repo limited to things I've created or generated myself, since I also use it as a personal backup, and therefore disabled issues and pulls. I'm always happy to hear feedback and ideas especially in comments on youtube or so, but I'd rather not have an open list of tasks and things waiting for me to respond to in what is a collection of products I made in my free time. Thanks for understanding!

If you want to support me, which I'd highly appreciate but you don't have to, then feel free to leave me a tip for my music on [bandcamp](https://aquanode.bandcamp.com), my songs are all free too!

Pairs with IRConvolve. |
| ~<br />**[ClipPreserve](effects/clippreserve/)** | A detail-preserving clipper: it extracts the content lost to clipping via a polarity-inverted delta chain and blends it back in, so hi-hats survive on top of loud subbass. |
| <img src="effects/eq-octave-resonator/assets/Icon.webp" width="64" align="center" /><br />**[EQ Octave Resonator](effects/eq-octave-resonator/)** | An array of parallel note-tuned bandpass filters with selectable resonating octaves and notes, per-octave volume sliders, and a wet-only mode that cancels the incoming signal. |

| <img src="effects/tapelectric/assets/Icon.webp" width="64" align="center" /><br />**[TapElectric](effects/tapelectric/)** | A tape deck simulation adding warm electric hum and white tape noise - less about transforming the sound (though saturation and wobble are there) and more about the imperfect tape atmosphere. |
| <img src="effects/vocode/assets/Icon.webp" width="64" align="center" /><br />**[Vocode](effects/vocode/)** | A classic filter-bank vocoder with up to 256 bands: modulator envelopes gate the carrier's bands for the characteristic "talking synthesizer" effect, or richly self-gated robotic textures without a sidechain. |

## Spectral Suite

A collection of a few, mostly effect plugins built on a shared FFT-based engine for real-time spectral analysis and manipulation - especially suited for colorbass, botanica, and experimental sound design. See the [suite overview](spectral/) for details.

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| <img src="spectral/assets/Icon.webp" width="64" align="center" /><br />**[SpectralCompare](spectral/spectralcompare/)** | A live spectrogram with sidechain overlay, delta display, spectral EQ drawing, morphing/vocoding-style processing, rolling spectrogram mode, and a sharp spectral reassignment view - analysis and shaping in one interface. |
| **[SpectralCompress](spectral/spectralcompress/)** | SpectralCompress is heavily inspired by [robbert-vdh's Spectral Compressor](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug), with the addition that you can freely draw the **target curve** with your mouse instead of relying on a polynomial curve filter by default. |
| **[SpectralEdit](spectral/spectraledit/)** | A synth that loads up to 1 minute of audio into an editable spectrogram: select, rotate, flip, blur, draw, compress, and scrub spectral content, then play it back repitched via MIDI. |
| **[SpectralEnhance](spectral/spectralenhance/)** | Same controls as SpectralGate, but frequencies are pulled *towards* the gate line instead of deleted - a spectral brickwall compressor, upwards or downwards. |
| **[SpectralFilter](spectral/spectralfilter/)** | Draw custom filter curves (±24 dB) directly onto the live spectrum, with multiple FFT resolutions, a random curve generator, per-bin frequency/phase/panning control, IR export, and a fully color-customizable UI. |
| **[SpectralGate](spectral/spectralgate/)** | Frequency-selective gating: two vertical frequency bounds and a drawable amplitude threshold decide what passes, with invert mode and tilt EQ - for band carving, noise removal, and creative filtering. |
| **[SpectralLatency](spectral/spectrallatency/)** | Spectral delay over up to 8192 FFT bins: draw a delay curve along the frequency range - including "negative" delay that sends the rest of the sound out earlier. |
| **[SpectralLock](spectral/spectrallock/)** | A colorbass sound effect using polyphonic spectral filter bank resynthesis and a note locking matrix, including shimmer and modulation effects. |
| **[SpectralMorph](spectral/spectralmorph/)** | A high-quality Spectral Morphing plugin, in fact a spectral vocoder, that merges two sounds into each other using cepstral analysis and other methods. |
| **[SpectralSmoothe](spectral/spectralsmoothe/)** | A live spectral smoothing / freezing / evolution effect made reusing code from the Grainfreeze Plugin. |
| **[SpectralResolve](spectral/spectralresolve/)** | A high-resolution reassignment-based spectral analyzer focused on sharp low-frequency inspection, with FFT sizes up to 16384, decimation for enhanced bass resolution, and a sidechain comparison path. |
| **[SpectralStereoize](spectral/spectralstereoize/)** | A spectral Mid/Side processor: draw stereo width curves across the frequency spectrum, from full mono collapse to extreme expansion per frequency range, with sidechain reference display. |

## Standalone Programs

| Program | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| <img src="programs/simpledaw/assets/Icon.webp" width="64" align="center" /><br />**[SimpleDAW](programs/simpledaw/)** | A very simple standalone DAW that can load 64-bit Windows .vst3 plugins - a minimal host for sketching and testing. Has many flaws and bugs in it, but it is usable. |

## Android Apps

Android `.apk` Projects have been tested on Android 15. Android Apps are rather difficult to maintain, they may not work with older or newer versions.
The apps should work fine, but I for example had some problems with sound output on the speaker one of my devices while having a MIDI Keyboard connected to my phone on its USB C port using a USB 3.0 to USB C adapter. This issue however happend on one of two phones I tested the apps with, and when I used headphones everything worked well on both devices. So, these are considered "playground" apps.

| App | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| ~<br />**[AudioStretcher for Android](apps/audiostretcher-for-android/)** | A port of the simple AudioStrecher using the Rubberband Library for Android. |
| <img src="synths/aquanode-modular/assets/Icon.png" width="64" align="center" /><br />**[Aquanode Modular for Android](apps/aquanode-modular-for-android/)** | A port of Aquanode Modular for Android. Contains all the modules from the original and a MIDI keyboard in the bottom to play with your fingers. Patches are compatible with the Windows version. External MIDI Device highly recommended! |
| <img src="synths/virtual-dx7/assets/GUI.png" width="64" align="center" /><br />**[VirtualDX7 for Android](apps/virtual-dx7-for-android/)** | An Android port of VirtualDX7 with some effects borrowed from my Aquanode Modular VST. |

## Repository Structure

Plugins are distinguished by whether they are **effects** or **sound generators** (synths). 
Every plugin folder follows the same layout of `README.md`, a text file describing what the plugin is about, an `assets` folder with images, screenshots or sound examples of the respective plugin, and a `src` folder with the actual source code.

## How to Compile

There are many ways to compile the JUCE plugins, it gets straightforward after you did it a few times. Writing `CMakeLists` is a common way to compile the plugins, however I simply used JUCE's `Projucer` directly, which is a small GUI tool to set up what you need. In most cases, you specify the name and version of your plugin, whether it is an effect or synth, and make sure that you `use static runtime` in the Visual Studio Release Settings so the plugin embeds the C++ runtime libraries to make the plugins run on any machine and not only machines with the specific version of them you currently happen to have. 

Using Projucer generates a `.jucer` file, which I added in many `src` folders (in the events where I kept them). You can regenerate these yourself very easily using Projucer. Projucer also constructs the surrounding folder system when you create the project by clicking the Visual Studio Export button inside Projucer. The only step left is to copy and paste my source code (in most cases simply the `PluginEditor.h/.cpp` and `PluginProcessor.h/.cpp` files) into the `Source` Code folder that Projucer generates right next to the `.jucer` file. For this repository here, I used `src` as the name for the folder in which the code files are all located here, as this is more adjacent to how github handles the naming.

## Credits

Most plugins were made with the help of Claude AI. The plugins are, except stated otherwise, released under the AGPLv3 License for freely distributed JUCE projects. External libraries used in these projects comply or are compatible with this license to the best of my knowledge.

## Personal Note

If you scrolled this far - thank you! Here is a little more about myself. 

One thing I really don’t like as an artist is not owning my tools. Online activation, license servers, and “phone-home” plugins are common practices in modern creative software. I understand why they’re used, but I’m not sure why online activation is so prevalent rather than something like a personalized offline installer - which some vendors kindly provide. These online systems create unnecessary dependencies and take control away from artists who simply want reliable tools. That’s why all of my plugins are fully self-contained and activation-free. There are no installers, no online authorization or accounts, and nothing that can suddenly stop working because a server goes offline or similar - hence, my software is also open source so anyone can maintain it as long as they want.

Furthermore, I value creative, colorful, and genuinely human design and want interfaces that feel tactile, expressive, natural and alive. Tools should invite playful curiosity and comfort, with warmth, depth, and personality. They should be a joy to use and evoke a sense of freedom whilst having their own character. Even though I use AI to make my plugins, which goes against some of these ideals, I still care about them and am glad that these AI systems gave me the ability to create them - there are many projects I would never have found the time nor the mental energy for otherwise, so I hope that is understandable!

Have fun with the plugins! - aquanode, 2026
